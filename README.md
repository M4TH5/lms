# Welcome to M4TH5 \| LMS Documentation

This is the complete set of M4TH5 \| LMS Guides for users of M4TH5 \| LMS. It contains the following three guides:

* Administrator guide
* Teacher guide
* Developer guide

Most users will not need to read all the guides and will have plenty of information \(maybe too much\) just going through the teacher guide. However, if you want to know more or your role in your organisation is specifically that of a LMS administrator or a developer or sysadmin, you might be interested in the Admin Guide and the Developer Guide that follows.

If you are looking at this documentation on the web, and if you find any issue, please consider creating an account on [https://gitbook.com](https://gitbook.com/) and submitting change requests directly. This website allows it, so why not become a documentation contributor and help M4TH5 \| LMS become more accessible to others?

To proceed, just click any section in the table of contents or search for a specific topic from the search bar.
